# DevRadar Web
MVP to study JS stack (Node.js, React, React Native) proposed by RocketSeat on Omnistack Week 10.

## Description
This part of the project is a webapp to register new devs that will be shown on mobile. To make this registration, 
the dev will fill his github username, the techs that he works with and his coordinates (they will be filled up 
automatically with browser geolocations). These data will be sent to the backend to be persisted on MongoDB Atlas.
Besides that, the webapp will list all registered devs, in card format.
See the print below:

## Future improvements
This is just a MVP, here are some ideas to make it better:
* create a title bar with app logo
* improve layout using a screen with a modal
* implement update and delete controls on cards
